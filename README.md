# To-Do-Lists
A menu with a list of categories for chores/To Do Lists. When a category is clicked the relevant list is displayed.

This is a simple example of an app that uses multiple screens. OnClickListener is used in java to detect when the user presses a category. This is more efficient than using the standard OnClick method which is usually used for buttons and can be quite limited.

The lists are created with an ArrayList and a For Loop on each screen/category. They are displayed using Vertical Linear Layout rather than a ListView. Although ScrollView has been incorporated on all the categories so users can scroll on the longer lists and also use the scroll feature if there phone is in landscape mode and the whole of the verical list does not fit on the screen.

Please name this project To Do Lists in order for it to work and copy and paste the appropriate java and xml elements. Where they don't exist you will have to create new java and xml files with the correct names. Also don't forget that these need to be defined in the Android Manifest. Which is why you need to copy and paste the Android Manifest and replace the existing one in order for this to work.
